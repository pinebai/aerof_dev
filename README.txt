Aero-F is a finite volume CFD code developed by the Farhat Research Group (www.stanford.edu/group/frg). It features capabilities for coupled multi-physics aeroelastic and aerothermoelastic simulations, and parallel implementaton using domain-decomposition methods. The source code is published online for the convenience of group members and approved third party users. It is neither "public domain" (in the sense of the intellectual property rights being forfeited) nor "open source" (in the sense of being freely licensed) unless otherwise explicitly noted in individual source code files. Stanford University makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, nor assumes any liability for the use of this software.
